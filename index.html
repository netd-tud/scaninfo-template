        <h2>About Our Scans</h2>
        <p>
            We are researchers trying to improve the Internet. 
            You have probably found our scanning node because you see incoming scan traffic reaching your network. 
            You do not need to worry, we are a research team focusing on improving the Internet security.
            You can find a list of scans running on this node below.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Scanning campaigns currently running on this node</h2>
        <table>

        <h2>You don't want to be scanned?</h2>
        <p>
            Of course, we can also exclude your network from our scans. <br>
            This way nothing will arrive at your edge. <br>
            We just need your prefix.
